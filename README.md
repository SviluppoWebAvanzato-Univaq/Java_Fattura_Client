# FatturaREST_Client
> Example client for the RESTful API "Fattura" (Invoice) developed with Apache Commons HTTP

 This is a simple client for the "Fattura" (invoice) RESTful API developed during the course lectures. It shows how to call the service using Apache Commons HTTP.
 
## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  [**Sviluppo Web Avanzato course**](https://people.disim.univaq.it/~dellapenna/content.php?page=students). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 11th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

This is a Maven-based project. Simply download the code and open it in any Maven-enabled IDE such as Netbeans or Eclipse.
